# ProcessingJS_Minigames

Single-file game projects written in Processing.js.

The ones I've made so far were edited on Khan Academy's javascript editor, which is intended for spinoffs and a user's ability to fiddle with the code itself, hence the "adjustable parameters".

An easy way to try out the games is on their Khan Academy pages, at the provided links.
